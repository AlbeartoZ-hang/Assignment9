# Assignment 9
## Objectives

To gain an understanding of dynamic memory allocation and linked lists.

### Part 1
1. Write a program `linkedlist.c` creating a node structure as described in class.  Implement the following functions for integers: 
    - `printList()`: given a linked list, print out the list
    - `add()`: given a linked list and an integer, add a node with the integer to the beginning of the list.
    - `remove()`: given a linked list and an integer, remove the first instance of that integer in the list.  Print an error message if the integer is not found.
    - `clear()`: given a linked list, empty the entire linked list (delete all nodes).
    - `smallestLength()`: Given two linked lists of integers, write a function to find the length of the smallest list. 
    - `smallestSum()`:Given two linked lists of integers, write a function to find the list with the smallest sum


### Part 2

In a text file `assignment9.txt`, answer the following questions:

1. Thoroughly compare and contrast malloc() and calloc(). Make sure to include details about parameters, return values, etc.
2. How would you determine the size of an allocated portion of memory?
3. Why do you have to free memory on the heap but not on the stack? 
4. Why do you need to test the return value from malloc?
